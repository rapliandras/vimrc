# the most awesome .vimrc

I currently set up my dev environment to contain tools for PHP,
Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL development.

Code linting, auto completion, testing, debugging.
Also configs for some unexpectedly cool stuff like my spotify plugin for vim (will be uploaded soon), etc.

I know, this is very specific to everyone,
but if you have a suggestion to further improve this - if you notice something I missed and suggest using,
please do a PR or something :)

Any questions?
